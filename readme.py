## Overview

The purpose of this code is to provide an optimized way to evaluate multiple machine learning models. It calculates performance metrics, including classification metrics like accuracy and precision, as well as regression metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error). 

The results are visualized for easier comparison, and confusion matrices are generated for detailed insights.

## Key Features

- **Multi-model Evaluation**: Trains multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) simultaneously.
- **Optimized Execution**: Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallelized model training and evaluation.
- **Detailed Metrics**: Outputs various metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, MCC, and MSE.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Comparison graph of all models' performance metrics.
  - Confusion matrices for each model.
  - A plot of MSE values for all models.
- **Flexibility**: Allows fine-tuning of model parameters for better performance.

## Models Used

The following models are implemented and evaluated:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**  
2. **Logistic Regression**  
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with RBF kernel  
4. **Decision Tree Classifier**  
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Classification Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision (weighted)
  - Recall (weighted)
  - F1 Score (weighted)
  - Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
- **Regression Metric**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
